I am a responsible, dedicated, and committed person, passionate about Soccer and Artificial Intelligence. I like tackling new challenges and staying at the forefront of advancements in AI and robotics 🤖.

 With experience as a Data Scientist and Deep Learning Engineer 🧑‍💻, and a Master's thesis focused on making Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search (NAS) more efficient and generalizable, I embrace a proactive approach to my work 💡. My daily motivation comes from my family, my thirst for knowledge, and my drive to apply cutting-edge technologies to help solve the problems our society faces 🌍.
 
In my free time, I enjoy playing sports ⚽ or watching movies 🎥. Feel free to reach out to me using any of the social buttons below.
